https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fe02e2-b886-4bf3-a615-d6b98070a39a

## Install

```bash
$ npm install awsctx --global
```

## Usage

Once installed globally, just call `awsctx` to start using it.

The current profile will be saved at `~/.aws/awsctx`.

You can switch to tell AWS CLI what the current profile is by exporting it as `AWS_PROFILE`:

```
echo 'export AWS_PROFILE=$(cat ~/.aws/awsctx)' >> ~/.extra
```

Enjoy your unchained, free life.
